# Varo

Play Varo with your friends. Just put the jar file into your plugins folder, restart your server, edit the config.yml to your liking, restart again, then dispatch /varo start to start a round of Varo; to terminate the round prematurely use /varo end.

**Please note that you need Spigot 1.12.2. Spigot 1.12 is not going to cut it.** If you encounter any bugs using Spigot 1.12.2, please [create an issue](https://github.com/timmyrs/Varo/issues/new).
